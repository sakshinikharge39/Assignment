I made two different one for backend and another for frontend

(1)frontend:
Fistly  I create react app : my-app using command "npx create-vite".

In src folder, there is app.js file.

I have add extra feature of keyboard click : "onKeyUp".

this is add in index.js: <App />

In App.css i have add some styling for example keyframes and media query

(2)Backend:
server.js is file of backend.

firstly I installed required libraries "axios": "^1.6.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "node-persist": "^3.1.3"
I used postman for database.

because of storage data will be stored in JSON format in storage file.

I used "await storage.clear();" to clear old data on server start
